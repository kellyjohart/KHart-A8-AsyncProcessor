# 🚀 Asynchronous Number Processor

This project demonstrates the use of multi-threading in Java to efficiently process numerical data. It reads integers from a file, processes them asynchronously, and calculates the frequency of each unique number.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application performs the following tasks:

1. **Asynchronous Data Retrieval**: Utilizes multi-threading to read and process data from `output.txt` efficiently.
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Counts the occurrences of each unique number in the dataset and displays the results.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Enhances performance by processing data concurrently.
- **Frequency Calculation**: Provides a count of how often each number appears in the dataset.

## 🗂️ File Structure

- `Assignment8.java`: Contains the main logic for data processing and analysis.
- `output.txt`: The input file containing the numerical data to be processed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kellyjohart/KHart-A8-AsyncProcessor.git
   cd KHart-A8-AsyncProcessor
